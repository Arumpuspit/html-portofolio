<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Introduce, I am arum Puspita. Born on September 16, 2004 in a relatively small district, namely Magetan Regency. Since childhood I have loved to write.</p>

<p>My pleasure in writing leads me to keep looking for new ideas for my writings. Learning to make the Web is one of my efforts to stay and be able to write. On a Web site this will also be a place to share my writing.</p>

<p>Everyone who likes to write will also be happy if their writing is read by others. That is why in addition to writing or the content of a beautiful writing, beautiful pictures are needed on a website. Besides writing, I also really like to organize or design.</p>
